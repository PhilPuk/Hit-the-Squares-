# Hit-the-Squares-
My first SFML game

I only uploaded the full game here, no source code.
I would have uploaded the whole project so the source code is there aswell, but it said it was to big and I have to do upload in small portions...
Yeah I was to lazy for that.

I coded the game with the tutorial of @Suraj Sharma.

This was the first game I made with SFML, so don't expect to much.
The menu and highscores were made by myself to get some general experience with the library.
Highscores only get saved locally int a .txt file.

Library: SFML

Developer: Snakyta
